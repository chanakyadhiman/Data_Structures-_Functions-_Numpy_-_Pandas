Assignment Questions:
Section A: Data Structures & Control Structures
- Create a list of 5 integers. Perform and print the result of the following operations: append, extend, insert, remove, pop, clear, index, count, sort, and reverse.
- Create a tuple that stores 3 student names. Try changing the second name in the tuple. What happens? Explain why.
- Create a set of integers with some duplicate values. Print the set and explain the output.
- Create a dictionary with the keys: 'name', 'age', and 'city'. Update the age and add a new key 'email'. Print the final dictionary.

Write a script that checks if a person is eligible to vote (age ≥ 18). Take age as a variable and print the appropriate message.
Given a 'marks' variable, print the grade:
- 90 and above: 'A'
- 75–89: 'B'
- 50–74: 'C'
- Below 50: 'Fail'

- Given a number, check if it's positive, and if it is also even. If not positive, print if it's zero or negative.

Section B: Numpy
Create:
- A scalar using np.array(5)
- A 1D array with values 1 to 5
- A 2D array (2x3) with values from 10 to 60 in steps of 10
- Generate a 4x4 Numpy array of random integers between 0 and 100 using np.random.randint().
- Create a 2D numpy array of shape (3x3). Convert it into a pandas DataFrame and add column names: 'A', 'B', 'C'.
